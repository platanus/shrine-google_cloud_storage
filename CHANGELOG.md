## [Unreleased]

## 2.0.1 - 2019-10-01

### Changed
- "google-cloud-storage" dependency has been updated to version 1.21.1.

## 2.0.0 - 2019-02-12

### Added
- `clear!` now accepts a block for conditional deletion. If a block is provided, it will only delete the files for which the block evaluates to `true` (#31 by @hwo411)

### Changed
- `presign` has been updated to use the new Shrine 2.11 API. This is a breaking change if you use `presign`, and bumps the `shrine` dependency to `>= 2.11` (#25 by @janko)
- This gem now uses `Shrine.with_file`, introduced in Shrine 2.11 (#29 by @janko)

### Fixed
- `clear!` was potentially not deleting every file (#26 by @janko)

## 1.0.1 - 2018-02-13

### Changed
- Moved tests to HTTP.rb (#23 by @janko-m)

### Fixed
- `presign` now correctly returns the headers needed for the `PUT` request (#23 by @janko-m)

## 1.0.0 - 2017-12-29

### Added
- You can specify a project when creating a storage (#16 by @rosskevin)
- Authentication is now delegated to [`google-cloud-ruby`](http://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-ruby/#/docs/google-cloud-storage/master/guides/authentication#projectandcredentiallookup), which enables credentials discovery
- `#url` now supports presigning (`url(expires: â€¦)`), matching the S3 storage (#16 by @rosskevin)

### Changed
- switched to `google-cloud-storage` gem (#16 by @rosskevin)
- added a `test/create_test_environment.sh` script to setup a test environment automatically (#16 by @rosskevin)
- use `skip_lookup: true` when instanciating a bucket object to avoid an API call. This reduces the number of API calls for most operations, making them faster. It also allows operating on buckets with a restricted Service Account that does not have access to `storage.buckets.get` but can access the files. (#21)

### Removed
- removed support for `multi_delete`, as this feature has been deprecated in Shrine

## 0.2.0 - 2017-06-23

### Changed
- moved batching to `batch_delete`, so it is used for `multi_delete` (#11 by @janko-m)
- updated `google-api-client` to 0.13

## 0.1.0 - 2017-05-22
### Added
- First released version
- Base functionality (create objects, delete, copy, ...)
- Support for presigned URLs
- Support for default ACLs
- Support for setting custom headers
